### Hike Up

Hike up is a website clone, inspired by [Meet Up](https://www.meetup.com/). Hike Up can be used to create groups for other users with similar interests. and hosting events, both in person and online. Users can join groups that may interest them. Hike up was made with the idea that although hiking can be done solo, its best to go with a group.
